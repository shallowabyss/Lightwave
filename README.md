# Lightwave
Lightwave 3D Lscripts - Last checked on Lightwave version 10.1
### Modeler:
- 2PtPolyMaker - Select points and run script. It will generate 2 point polygons between the points.
- AllLayersFG - Brings all layers in an object to the foreground. Useful if you don’t work with the Statistics Window open.
- CenterPoint - Creates a centerpoint in the middle of a selection, then selects the point after it is created.
- ClearLyrNames - Clears the layer names off of layers.
- CloneToLayers - Copies the selected geometry to the defined layers.
- CloseAllButCurrent - Closes all of the open objects except for the current object.
- CycleApplySurfaces - It will take the selected geometry and keep applying textures to it until stopped. Useful for finding out what surface belongs on an object.
- DongleCheck - Checks if a dongle is plugged in when Modeler is started. Please note it requires a special install to work.
- DongleID - Alerts you to your Dongle ID number.
- Fast Set Value - Allows for the quick snapping of points in any axis including U and V.
- FixedCopyPaste - Copies the geometry and then selects it so you can then move the newly created geometry.
- IsolateLayer - Uses the selected polygons to detect which layer they are on, then brings those layers to the foreground.
- Janitor - Cleans up geometry by eliminating common problem geometry, merging points, and unifying polygons.
- LyrSurfRenamer - This script will add a prefix to layer names and/or surface names.
- MeshCombine - Combines two objects together with options.
- MeshMover - Copies the current object into a new object.
- MirrorPoints - Mirrors the points’ position based on chosen axis.
- MirrorToEmptyLayer - Mirrors the selected geometry to an empty layer instead of current layer.
- MoveIt - Saves user defined offsets for moving selected points or polygons and then move them accordingly.
- Partify - Creates a new part for each polygon on an object.
- PointsToNulls - Saves out the points’ positions to a scene file where they are converted into Nulls.
- PolyToSurfaces - Makes every polygon have its own surface.
- RadArray 8/9 - Radial array alternative that allows a background point as the center for the array operation. Different versions for LW8 and LW9+
- RealtimeSmooth - An interactive previewer for the Smooth tool.
- RemoveEmptyLayers - Removes the empty layers in an object.
- SaveAllObjects - Saves all objects.
- SelectAll - Selects all polygons in the current object.
- Selector - Allows for selecting/deselecting of points on chosen sides of axis.
- SelectPoint - Allows for interactive selection of a single point based on the point’s ID number.
- SelectSurfName - Selects/deselects polygons based on a search phrase (for their surface name).
- SelLyrRng - Selects layers based on a range.
- SelNegX - Selects all points on the negative X axis.
- SelOnePt - Selects one point on each group of connected polygons of the current object.
- SelPosX - Selects all points on the positive X axis.
- SendToBG - Takes the selected geometry and puts it in the background layer.
- SwapPoints - Swaps the point positions of the selected points.
- UFlip - Takes a user-defined part (which is usually one half of the model shown in the UV space) and flip its orientation over the 50% mark in the U axis in a given UV map.
- Weld Group - Weld pairs of points.
- Weld Group Average - Weld Average to pairs of points.

### Layout:
- AddRandomRotation - Adds random rotation to the selected objects in Layout.
- CloneHierarchyRepeat - Creates multiple clones of a selected hierarchy.
- CloneRename - Creates clones of a selected object and allows for the immediate renaming/numbering of the clones.
- CustomNewLight - Creates lights and saves the settings to create new lights (not clones) and create them across different instances of Lightwave.
- DisplaySubpatchLevel - Allows you to do a mass subpatch level change across in the scene.
- ExcludeAllLights - Excludes all lights from the selected objects.
- HiddenToUnseen - Makes hidden objects UnseenByCamera, and visible objects seen by the camera.
- ItemState - Allows for the saving and loading of item render states on a scene by scene basis. Useful on large scenes which may be difficult to remember the item render states for each object when doing test renders.
- LightExclusion - Allows for batch excluding/including lights from objects or excluding/including objects from lights based on what is selected.
- LightsExcludeAllObjects - Excludes all objects from the selected lights.
- LoadItemsRepeat - Launches the load items repeat using a defined scene a chosen number of times.
- MakeSceneReadOnly - Makes the currently loaded scene file readonly so that changes cannot be saved to it.
- MergeDeselect - Merges the selected polygons and then deselects them.
- ModoCameraConversion - Gives the calculations for converting the Lightwave camera into a Modo Camera
- MorphSaver - Saves an object’s layers motion into a (linear) morph that can later be animated.
- MotLoader - Allows for quick loading of motion files using C:\Temp as a motion folder.
- MotSaver - Allows for quick saving of motion files using scene name, time stamp, and C:\Temp as a motion folder.
- MultipleKeys - Will select the chosen type of item that has multiple keyframes on it.
- MultipleLFS - Allows LoadFromScene from the selected lightwave scene files.
- NewCamera - Allows you to create a new camera with an optional target where you can define either a new null to target or an existing object.
- NullsToObj - Creates an OBJ from the nulls in a scene. Useful for converting tracking markers to geometry. (1000 Null Limit)
- ObjectMask - Creates a black and white matte pass of the selected objects in a scene.
- RandomColor - Makes every selected object a random wireframe color.
- Rename - A mass renaming utility.
- ReplaceSelected - Allows for replacing objects with nulls, a single object, or an object from a list of objects. Also has random and sequential options as well as wireframe color options.
- ReplaceTextures - Replaces the images with images from another directory.
- ReplaceWithLights - Allows replacing of objects and cameras with Lights.
- SaveSelected - Allows for saving just the selected objects as either a normal save or a copy as well as adding an optional prefix.
- SaveTransformed - Batch save transformed objects with options.
- SelectActive - Takes the item selection and set’s their render checkbox to render. All other items will be turned off so they will not render.
- SelectMatteObjects - Selects all objects in the current (saved) scene that have the Matte attribute checked.
- VisibilityFrontface - Sets the viewport visibility to frontface wireframe.
- VisibilityNone - Sets the viewport visibility to hidden.
